/// vanishes). If in "memory mode", the objects are not written to disk,
/// otherwise they are stored in a subdirectory of the SQLITE database file
/// directory called "dicom". Inside, a folder structure created which contains
/// a directoy for each study, containing a directory for each series, containing
/// a file for each object. The corresponding UIDs are used as filenames.
/// Thumbnais for each image can be created; if so, they are stored in a directory
/// parallel to "dicom" directory called "thumbs".
